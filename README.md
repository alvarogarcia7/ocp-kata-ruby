# Open-Closed Principle (OCP) Kata

For more information on the kata, there is more information [here](http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/events/225894375/)

This is the most important idea:

In this style of kata you must follow these rules:

1. Write a failing test.
2. Write a setup that builds a object that makes the tests pass.
3. Write next failing test.
4. Can you make it pass by just changing the setup and creating new classes?
  - Yes: Great! Go back to step 3.
  - No: Refactor until you can! 

## Participants
